	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>It is well known that working memory performance changes
      with age. Two recent computational models of working mem-
      ory, TBRS* and SOB-CS, corresponding to two distinct causes
      of forgetting, namely time-based decay and interference, are
      applied on a set of complex span data produced by young and
      older adults. As expected, these models are unable to account
      for the older adult data. An investigation on the effect of the
      main parameters of these models showed that the poorer per-
      formance of older adult does not come from a weaker encoding
      of items, or even a longer time spent on distractors, but rather
      on difficulties during the free time that immediately follows
      each distractor, as well as a higher level of confusion between
      items. These results are discussed with respect to the current
      theories of working memory and aging.</p>
