	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>On a cue-based retrieval account of sentence processing (Van Dyke
      & Lewis, 2003; Vasishth & Lewis, 2006), grammatical heads such as verbs provide
      retrieval cues that are used to distinguish between the target item and
      competitors in memory. Similarity based interference occurs when items share
      retrieval cues, which makes it harder to distinguish between them, causing both
      longer reading times (RTs) and lower question-response accuracy. Since lower
      accuracy could be the result from either incorrectly retrieving a competitor or
      simply failing to complete a retrieval (an unstarted or aborted process), it is
      unclear how RTs are related to question-response accuracy. We investigated this
      question with two approaches: (i) by using the outcome of multinomial processing
      trees modeling accuracy in a linear mixed model with RTs as a dependent variable,
      and (ii) by fitting RTs and accuracy with ACT-R.
