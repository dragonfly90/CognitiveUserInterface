	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Decisions from Experience (DFE) involve situations where decision
      makers sample information before making a final choice. Trying clothes before
      choosing a garment and enquiring about jobs before opting for one are some
      examples involving such situations. In DFE research, conventionally, the final
      choice that is made after sampling information is aggregated over all
      participants and problems in a given dataset. However, this aggregation does not
      explain the individual choices made by participants. In this paper, we test the
      ability of computational models of aggregate choice to explain choices at the
      individual level. Top three DFE models of aggregate choices are evaluated on how
      these models account for individual choices using the maximization criterion. A
      Primed-Sampler (PS) model, a Natural-Mean Heuristic (NMH) model, and an
      Instance-Based Learning (IBL) model are calibrated to explain individual choices
      (maximizing or non-maximizing) in the Technion Prediction Tournament (the largest
      publically available DFE dataset) and the generalization Hertwig2004 dataset. Our
      results reveal that all the three DFE models of aggregate choices perform average
      to explain individual choices. Although the IBL model performs slightly better
      than PS and NMH models; all the three models are able to account for all
      individuals in both the calibration and generalization datasets. We conclude by
      drawing implications for computational cognitive models in explaining individual
      choices in DFE research.</p>
