	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Most experiments in psycholinguistics use association strength
      obtained by group-level production frequencies to control experimental stimuli or
      to define experimental condition. Researchers assume that group-level production
      frequencies reflect association strength in the mental lexicon of each
      individual, and the validity of the above approach depends on this assumption. It
      is assumed that associates are produced by spreading activation from the cue to
      its targets as a function of their association strength. Two questions are
      warranted: (1) How does the cognitive system choose a response among the
      activated associates? (2) Why do people produce different associates if they
      share the same associative network? I present a simple connectionist model that
      explains how the same associative network might give rise to different responses,
      whose frequencies approximate the underlying individual association
      strengths.</p>
