	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Being treated fairly by others is an important social need.
      Experimentally, fairness can be studied using the Ultimatum Game in which the
      decision to reject a low, but non-zero, offer is seen as a way to punish the
      other player for an unacceptable division. The canonical explanation of such
      behavior is inequity aversion: people prefer equal outcomes over personal gains
      (Fehr, Schmidt, 1999). However, there is abundant evidence that the decision to
      reject a low offer can be changed by both contextual factors and emotional state,
      which cannot be satisfactorily explained by the inequity aversion model. </p>
