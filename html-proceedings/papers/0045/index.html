	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Reasoning processes have been one of the central targets for
      cognitive modeling. Modeling of reasoning processes appears as an even harder
      challenge during paradoxical conditions such as the Ship of Theseus paradox. This
      work attempts to model empirical data from a behavioral study on paradox
      resolution with different modeling techniques: discriminant analysis (DA),
      decision tree and neural networks. While each method has its own advantages and
      disadvantages, this paper attempts to compare and to contrast these methods
      trying to select the best model for future work. Identity judgments have long
      been at the center of philosophical debates, e.g., is a car still the same after
      being fixed after a serious accident? Beyond the philosophical debates on the
      nature of objects and the concept of identity, it has also been a matter of
      interest how laymen respond to the identity question under different
      circumstances. This empirical study focuses on a famous paradox from ancient
      Greece, the Ship of Theseus. Answers to this paradox are tried to be predicted by
      a Conceptual Tendency Test (CTT) tapping the concept of &#8220;sameness&#8221;.
      The main aim of this paper is to present and compare the results of three
      predictive models in terms of their accuracy (predictive success) and to discuss
      the theoretical basis of the findings. </p>
