	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>An important source of constraints on unified theories of
      cognition is their ability to perform complex tasks that are challenging for
      humans. Malware reverse-engineering is an important type of analysis in the
      domain of cyber-security.  Rapidly identifying the tasks that a piece of malware
      is designed to perform is an important part of reverse engineering that is
      manually performed in practice as it relies heavily on human intuition.  We
      present an automated approach to malware task identification using two different
      approaches using ACT-R cognitive models.  Against a real-world malware dataset,
      these cognitive models significantly out-perform baseline approaches while
      demonstrating key cognitive characteristics such as the ability to generalize to
      new categories and to quickly adapt to a change of environment.  Finally, we
      discuss the implications of our approach for applying cognitive models to complex
      tasks.</p>
