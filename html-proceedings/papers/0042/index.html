	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Regarding to the investigation of the representations of words,
      previous researchers often ask participants to rate the similarities between
      emotion words (Barrett, 2004; Cheng, Cheng, Cho, & Chen, 2013; Romney, Moore, &
      Rusch, 1997), or to give the scores upon certain psychological dimensions (e.g.
      valence, arousal)(Bradley & Lang, 1999; Cho, Chen, & Cheng, 2013; Morgan & Heise,
      1988). These direct similarity-based or anchor-based ratings indeed emerge
      categorical properties of emotion words according to existing theoretical
      postulations. However, it is unknown whether there are implicit dimensions
      embedded within their semantic representations. Furthermore, it is also important
      to know how the semantic representation of emotion words would present their
      meaning relationships in terms of considering a multiple word-meaning pool.</p>
