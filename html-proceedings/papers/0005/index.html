	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The performance of cognitive models often depends on the settings
      of specific 
      model parameters, such as the rate of memory decay or the speed of motor 
      responses. The systematic exploration of a model's parameter space can 
      yield relevant insights into model behavior and can also be used to improve the
      fit of a model to human data. However, exhaustive parameter space searches
      quickly run into a combinatorial explosion as the number of parameters
      investigated increases. Taking an established instance-based learning task as
      example, we show how simulation using parallel computing and derivative-free
      optimization methods can be applied to investigate the effects of different
      parameter settings. We find that both global optimization methods involving
      genetic algorithms as well as local methods yield satisfactory results in this
      case. Furthermore, we show how a model implemented in a specific cognitive
      architecture (ACT-R) can be mathematically reformulated to prepare the
      application of derivative-based optimization methods which
      promise further efficiency gains for quantitative analysis.</p>
