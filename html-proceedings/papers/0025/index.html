	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How do people come to a decision when facing conflicting options?
      In the case of delay discounting (e.g. Frederick, Loewenstein, &
      O&#8217;Donoghue, 2002) &#8211; the choice between an immediate but small reward
      and a delayed but large one &#8211; research generated a multitude of descriptive
      models pinpointing precisely how people devalue and choose rewards across delays
      (Doyle, 2013). This descriptive and outcome-centered perspective has been
      complemented recently by models focusing on the process dynamics leading to delay
      discounting decisions (Rodriguez, Turner, & McClure, 2014). We present work that
      embraces and adds to this dynamic approach in two ways. First, we demonstrate how
      dovetailing continuous dynamic modeling and continuous empirical measures
      (Dshemuchadse, Scherbaum, & Goschke, 2012; Spivey, Grosjean, & Knoblich, 2005)
      constrains the conceptualization of the processes underlying a decision. Second,
      we extend the dynamic approach from the intra-trial time scale of single
      decisions to the inter-trial time scale of sequences of decisions (compare Duran
      & Dale, 2014) to explore their interacting effects on behavior (Scherbaum,
      Dshemuchadse, & Kalis, 2008; Scherbaum, Dshemuchadse, Leiberg, & Goschke, 2013).
      We present a dynamic computational model of delay discounting behavior (Tuller,
      Case, Ding, & Kelso, 1994; see also O&#8217;Hora, Dale, Piiroinen, & Connolly,
      2013; van Rooij, Favela, Malone, & Richardson, 2013) that reproduces existing
      data (Scherbaum et al., 2013) and predicts new behavioral patterns such as a
      dependence of current choices on choice history or the temporal decay of these
      choice persistence effects. The model&#8217;s predictions are validated in three
      experiments, indicating the complementary value of harvesting decision dynamics
      at different time scales on the modeling and the experimental side of the
      investigation of delay discounting decisions.</p>
