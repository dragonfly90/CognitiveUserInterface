	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>ACT-R is a popular cognitive architecture. Although its
      psychological theory is well-investigated, it lacks a formal foundation. This
      inhibits computational analysis of cognitive models and leads to technical
      artifacts in ACT-R implementations. 

      In this paper we present an adaptable implementation of ACT-R derived from our
      formalization presented in previous work. We show how this formal approach
      supported by the use of the declarative programming language Constraint Handling
      Rules (CHR) leads to an implementation of the ACT-R close to the theory while
      maintaining interoperability. Due to the adaptability of our implementation we
      are able to extend the conflict resolution strategy of the system by production
      rule refraction in our implementation easily avoiding the problem of
      over-programming in some ACT-R models. The use of CHR facilitates the application
      of analytical methods from the CHR ecosystem paving the way for ACT-R model
      analysis.</p>
