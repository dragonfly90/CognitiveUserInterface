	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In their fourth year, most children start to understand that
      someone else might have a false belief, which is different from the reality that
      the children know. The most studied experimental task to test this development is
      called the first-order false belief task. What kind of prior cognitive skills
      help children to pass the false belief task? There are hundreds of correlational
      studies that have shown that language and executive functions (such as inhibition
      and working memory) play a role. Moreover, several training studies have shown
      the importance of language and inhibition in the development of false belief
      reasoning. However, to the best of our knowledge there has been no training study
      (with normally developing children) to investigate the role of working memory
      strategies in the development of false belief reasoning.

      We present here a computational cognitive model to investigate transfer from
      working memory strategies to false belief reasoning. For this reason, in addition
      to the false belief task, we constructed two tasks that children encounter in
      their daily life: a pencil task (simple working memory) and a marble task
      (complex working memory). Our simulation results confirm our hypothesis that
      there is more transfer from the marble task to the first-order false belief task
      than from the pencil task to the first-order false belief task, because of the
      more complex working memory strategies that appear to be necessary in the false
      belief task. The results of our simulations suggest conceptual predictions to be
      tested experimentally.</p>
