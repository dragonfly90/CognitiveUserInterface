	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In order to formally validate cyber-physical systems, analytically
      tractable models of human control  are desirable.  While those models can be
      abstracted directly from human data, limitations on the amount and reliability of
      data can lead to overfitting and lack of generalization.  We introduce a
      methodology for deriving formal models of human control of cyber-physical systems
      based on the use of cognitive models. Analytical models such as Markov models can
      be derived from an instance-based learning model of the task built using the
      ACT-R cognitive architecture.  The approach is illustrated in the context of a
      robotic control task involving the choice of two options to control a robotic
      swarm.  The cognitive model and various forms of the analytical model are
      validated against each other and against human performance data.  The current
      limitations of the approach are discussed as well as its implications for the
      automated validation of cyber-physical systems.</p>
