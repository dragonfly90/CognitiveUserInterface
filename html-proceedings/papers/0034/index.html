	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We are using an algorithm based on a computational model of human
      memory to optimize the scheduling and repetition of individual items within a
      learning session. The model estimates the rate of forgetting for each participant
      to determine the order in which items should be repeated and to decide when
      previous items have been learned well enough to introduce a novel item. To
      improve the model further, we conducted an experiment to test how stable the
      parameter estimates are over time and across different materials. We have found
      that estimated rates of forgetting are stable over time within one type of
      material but not across different types of material. This finding has important
      implications for how information about a learner should be preserved between
      study sessions. </p>
