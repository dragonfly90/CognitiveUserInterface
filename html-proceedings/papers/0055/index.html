	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We humans spend almost a third of our lives asleep, and there is
      mounting evidence that sleep not only maintains, but actually improves many of
      our cognitive functions. Memory consolidation--the process of crystallizing and
      integrating memories into knowledge and skills--is particularly benefitted by
      sleep. We survey the evidence that sleep aids memory consolidation in various
      tasks--declarative and implicit--and review the basic neurophysiological
      structure of sleep with a focus on understanding what neural systems are
      involved. Drawing on research in machine learning, we discuss why it might be
      useful for humans--and robots, perhaps--to have such an offline period for
      processing, even though we are clearly capable of learning incrementally, online.
      Finally, we propose several mechanisms for use in computational memory models to
      approximate sleep-based consolidation.</p>
