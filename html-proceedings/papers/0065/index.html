	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We compare how the same cognitive model completes a task within
      two alternative modifications to a cognitive architecture to represent sleep
      deprivation. One modification (ACT-R/F) has a module that uses a biomathematical
      model of the effects of sleep deprivation on performance to drive parameter
      changes in the architecture that impact behavior and performance. The second,
      new, modification (ACT-R/&#934;) represents the effects of sleep deprivation on
      physiological systems and has these systems modulate cognition. The model
      completes the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) within both ACT-R/&#934; and
      ACT-R/F. We found that the two implementations produced similar response times
      (means) in simulated days one and two. However, the distribution of the response
      times across the two days of sleep deprivation varied between models. The
      ACT-R/&#934; model shows a wider distribution in both days 1 and 2 due to an
      increased and modulating production utility noise that affects its ability to
      select the correct rules consistently. Though they represent sleep deprivation in
      different ways, and on different levels, both of these implementations lead us
      towards a more unified understanding of how sleep deprivation affects our bodies,
      how we think and behave over time, and how to represent these effects.</p>
