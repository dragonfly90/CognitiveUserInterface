	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Surprise is a ubiquitous phenomenon that is implicated in many
      areas of cognition, from learning, to decision making, to creativity. For
      example, it has recently been proposed as a trigger for learning in robotic agent
      architectures. This paper describes a novel cognitive model of surprise based on
      the idea that surprise is fundamentally about explaining why the surprising event
      occurred; events that can be explained easily are less surprising than those that
      are more difficult to explain. Using explanations that people have produced, this
      surprise model builds a directed graph of explanations that link the setting and
      outcome of a given scenario, and uses this graph to predict surprise ratings.
      Simulations are reported which show that the model&#8217;s performance
      corresponds closely to the psychological evidence, as measured by people&#8217;s
      ratings of different surprising scenarios.</p>
