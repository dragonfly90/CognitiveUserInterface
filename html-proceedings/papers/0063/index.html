	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>It has been 25 years since Unified Theories of Cognition was
      published (Newell, 1990). In it, Newell outlines a vision to inspire generations
      of cognitive scientists and cognitive modelers; a quest for theories that provide
      comprehensive accounts of the human mind. As he put it:

      &#8220;A single system (mind) produces all aspects of behavior. It is one mind
      that minds them all. Even if the mind has parts, modules, components, or
      whatever, they all mesh together to produce behavior&#8230; If a theory covers
      only one part or component, it flirts with trouble from the start. It goes
      without saying that there are dissociations, interdependencies,
      impenetrabilities, and modularities&#8230; But they don&#8217;t remove the
      necessity of a theory that provides the total picture and explains the role of
      the parts and why they exist.&#8221; (Newell, 1990, pp. 17-18).
