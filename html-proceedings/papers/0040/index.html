	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>One of the challenges that infants have to solve when learn-
      ing their native language is to identify the words in a con-
      tinuous speech stream. Some of the experiments in Artificial
      Grammar Learning (Saffran, Newport, and Aslin (1996); Saf-
      fran, Aslin, and Newport (1996); Aslin, Saffran, and Newport
      (1998) and many more) investigate this ability. In these ex-
      periments, subjects are exposed to an artificial speech stream
      that contains certain regularities. Adult participants are typ-
      ically tested with 2-alternative Forced Choice Tests (2AFC)
      in which they have to choose between a word and another
      sequence (typically a partword, a sequence resulting from misplacing
      boundaries).</p>
