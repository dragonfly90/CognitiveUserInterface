	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Social psychology does not yet have a strong cognitive modeling
      tradition. This is not for lack of cognitive modeling tools that are relevant and
      useful for modeling social psychological phenomena. For instance, several
      researchers have successfully demonstrated how connectionist modeling techniques
      can be used to build computational explanations of key phenomena of interest to
      social psychologists, such as stereotyping, prejudice and priming (Kunda &
      Thagard, 1996; Schr&#246;der & Thagard, 2014). In this project we contribute to
      this important development by addressing a major obstacle to the progression of
      connectionist modeling in social psychology: That is, how can we reconcile the
      intuitive concepts that figure in the verbal explanations that pervade social
      psychological theories with formal properties and processes in connectionist
      models? We illustrate a systematic way of addressing this question by considering
      the theoretical concept of &#8216;social categories&#8217;, which plays a central
      role in social psychological theories. Using computer simulation, we show that if
      social categories are defined as &#8216;excluders&#8217; in connectionist models
      then key social psychological phenomena can be replicated, while maintaining a
      clear link with the intuitive concept of social categories. We discuss the
      broader implications of our simulation results for both social psychology and
      cognitive modeling.  </p>
