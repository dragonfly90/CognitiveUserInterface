	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>As we increasingly rely upon our computer information systems to
      store and operate on sensitive information, the methods we use to authenticate
      user identity also become more important. One of the most important such methods
      is the password. However, passwords that provide better security also tend to be
      more difficult to remember. They also tend to be difficult to type, and typing
      errors can have negative consequences, such as being locked out of a critical
      information system. We present a computational cognitive model of password
      rehearsal and a typing extension to the ACT-R cognitive architecture intended to
      study human-computer interaction issues in the usable security domain.</p>
