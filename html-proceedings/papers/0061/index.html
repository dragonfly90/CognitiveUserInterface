	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The concept of device- vs. task-orientation allows to identify
      subtasks that are especially prone to errors. Device-oriented tasks occur
      whenever a user interface requires additional steps that do not directly
      contribute to the users&#8217; goals. They comprise, but are not limited to,
      initialization errors and postcompletion errors (e.g. removing a bank card after
      having received money). The vulnerability of device-oriented tasks is often
      counteracted by making them obligatory (e.g. by not handing out the money before
      the bank card has been removed), making it even harder to predict where users
      will have problems with a given interface without dedicated user tests. In this
      paper we show how cognitive modeling can be used to predict error rates of
      device-oriented and task-oriented subtasks with respect to a given application
      logic. The process is facilitated by exploiting user interface meta information
      from model-based user interface development.</p>
