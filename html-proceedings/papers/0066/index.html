	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Cognitive models assume a one-to-one correspondence between task
      and goals. We argue that modeling a task by combining multiple goals has several
      advantages: a task can be constructed from components that are reused from other
      tasks, and it enables modeling thought processes that compete with or support
      regular task performance. To achieve this, we updated the PRIMs architecture (a
      derivative of ACT-R) with the capacity for parallel goals that have different
      activation levels. We use this extension to model visual distraction in two
      experiments by Katidioti et al. (submitted). The model provides explanations for
      the finding that distraction increases with task difficulty in a memory task, but
      decreases with task difficulty in a visual search task. </p>
