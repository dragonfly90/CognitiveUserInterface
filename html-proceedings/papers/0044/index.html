	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Lately two modules which aim to improve the modeling of human
      reasoning have been introduced into the ACT-R cognitive
      architecture &#8211; the Human Reasoning Module (HRM) and the
      Pre-Attentive and Attentive Vision Module (PAAV). This is a
      first attempt to create a domain-specific infrastructure as an extension
      of a cognitive architecture. The HRM defines the basic
      functionality of two different theories in human reasoning &#8211;
      the mental model theory and the mental logic theory. Thus, it
      is a step towards a &#8220;unified theory of human reasoning&#8221;. In this
      article we use a model of the continuity effect in spatial reasoning
      to evaluate this approach. The results show that the HRM
      is a clearly more convenient way to define ACT-R models for
      reasoning domains. However, as a unified theory of reasoning
      improvements are necessary before quantitative measures
      of all aspects in a reasoning task can be predicted.</p>
