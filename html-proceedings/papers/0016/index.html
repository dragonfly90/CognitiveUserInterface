	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In sequential diagnostic reasoning multiple pieces of information
      have to be combined to find a best explanation for observed symptoms (e.g.,
      Johnson & Krems, 2001). Tracking memory processes involved in reasoning proves
      difficult because they proceed without accompanying actions towards the
      environment. However, this is important in order to build and test cognitive
      models (Schulte-Mecklenbeck, K&#252;hberger, & Ranyard, 2011). Memory indexing is
      a novel method to study the time course of information processing in memory
      during reasoning and decision making (Jahn & Braatz, 2014; Renkewitz & Jahn,
      2012) by recording eye movements. The basic principle underlying memory indexing
      is that people look at an emptied spatial location when retrieving information
      that has been associated with the spatial location during encoding (e.g.,
      Richardson & Spivey, 2000). We use memory indexing to reveal memory dynamics in
      sequential diagnostic reasoning in order to test process assumptions derived from
      cognitive models on reasoning and belief updating.</p>
