          <p id=abstract>Introduction

      What makes a decision strategy simple or complex? In this project, we
      investigated the time costs for cognitive sub-processes and bottlenecks of
      decision strategies. In order to gauge these time costs, we formally implemented
      two prominent decision strategies as well as a working memory (WM) load
      manipulation within the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson, 2007) and
      compared the performance of the strategies under varying degrees of WM load. We
      tested the simulation results from this analysis in an empirical study. 

      The first tested strategy is tallying (TALLY), which integrates across several
      attributes to make a decision (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996). The second strategy
      is the take-the-best heuristic (TTB), which relies on one best attribute (or
      reason) and considers further attributes only if the decision alternatives do not
      differ on that reason. As TTB does not integrate across multiple attributes and
      often searches only part of the information, it is considered a relatively
      &#8220;simple&#8221; strategy (Gigerenzer, Todd, & the ABC Research Group, 1999).


      Using TALLY and TTB as paradigmatic examples of integrative and one-reason
      decision making strategies, respectively, we evaluated the hypothesis that
      integrative strategies induce higher cognitive costs than one-reason
      strategies&#8212;as indicated, for instance, by longer response times and lower
      execution accuracy when set under WM load (cf. Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1993).
