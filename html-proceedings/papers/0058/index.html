	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Speeded and/or simple response tasks may be cognitively modeled by
      a random walk process that accumulates to threshold. In cases of tasks where
      mainly one characteristic response is observed, at varying latencies, then random
      walks involving only positive drifts that each arrive at a single threshold,
      provide a suitable accumulation modeling account of the data; and advantageously,
      this accumulation model is exactly described by the shifted Wald (SW) probability
      density function. We will demonstrate how the SW distribution is thus a
      noteworthy cognitive model for these tasks, which uniquely possesses
      simultaneously, high utility as an objective data measurement tool for the
      response time (RT) distributions. Per each experiment condition, its three
      parameters can decompose the observed mean RT value, quantify the shape and
      characteristics of the observed RT distribution, and account for significant
      differences between distributions with near-identical mean values; regardless of
      whether one accepts the cognitive interpretation of the random-walk accumulation
      process. We present the SW model and demonstrate its efficiency and utility on
      both simulated and real data.</p>
