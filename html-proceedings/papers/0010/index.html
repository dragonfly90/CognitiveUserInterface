	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Using cognitive modeling to predict user behavior in the
      human-computer interaction domain is a promising field, but often hindered by
      practical problems. Especially the creation of a mock-up of the technical system
      under evaluation is often a tedious and time-consuming task. For the growing
      number of HTML-based applications, the modeling toolbox ACT-CV (Halbr&#252;gge,
      2013) provides direct access to the user interface, removing the necessity to
      create a mock-up before the actual modeling can start. A down-side of this
      approach is that unaltered applications often cannot be used for fast-time
      simulation. This paper presents a new tool that solves this problem by capturing
      UI states and also the control flow of HTML applications and by transforming both
      into finite automata that can be used for fast-time simulation.</p>
