	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Selective attention is paramount for adaptive behavior as it
      biases information processing towards stimuli that are relevant for achieving our
      goals. The mechanisms underlying this bias are under debate, however: Whereas one
      class of models postulates that selective attention solely relies on the
      amplification of goal-relevant information (e.g. Cohen, Dunbar, & McClelland,
      1990), a second class of models deems additional inhibitory processes necessary
      to suppress distracting stimuli (e.g. Houghton & Tipper, 1994). 

      Here, we explore the explanatory value of both accounts from a dynamic
      perspective that focuses on the continuous unfolding of goal-directed behavior
      over time (see Scherbaum, Dshemuchadse, Fischer, & Goschke, 2010; Spivey & Dale,
      2006). We present two variants of a Dynamic Neural Field model (see e.g.,
      Johnson, Spencer, & Sch&#246;ner, 2008; Sandamirskaya, Zibner, Schneegans, &
      Sch&#246;ner, 2013) that incorporate the diverging assumptions regarding the
      nature of selective attention. Running simulations of an attentional
      set-switching paradigm with both models, we show that &#8211; even though they
      make similar predictions with regard to discrete markers of performance like
      response times &#8211; the continuous development of response tendencies over the
      course of single trials differs markedly whether or not inhibitory processes take
      part in attentional selection. 

      To test these dynamic predictions empirically, human participants completed the
      same set-switching paradigm using mouse-tracking as a continuous measure of
      performance (see e.g., Scherbaum et al., 2010). Comparing modeled and observed
      behavior revealed clear evidence for the persisting amplification of previous
      target information but no signs of sustained distracter suppression.

      These findings illustrate that dovetailing dynamic computational modeling with
      continuous measures of behavior can open promising avenues for understanding the
      mechanisms underlying fundamental cognitive abilities.
