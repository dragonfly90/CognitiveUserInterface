	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Decision heuristics are often described as fast and frugal,
      meaning that they take little time and require relatively few computations to
      make a decision when compared to optimal decision systems (Gigerenzer & Todd,
      1999). Fast & Frugal Trees are one heuristic that are a special case of decision
      trees in which there is a possible exit out of the decision process at every cue
      considered in the tree (Luan, Schooler, & Gigeren- zer, 2011).

      There is currently no computational account of how hu- mans learn heuristics like
      F&FT-based decision processes. This is a significant gap in our scientific
      understanding, and we aim to begin addressing that gap in this effort. In this
      ab- stract we report results from a pilot study assessing Instance- based
      Learning Theory (IBLT) as an account of human learn- ing from experience in
      domains where F&FTs may be good decision heuristics, such as diagnostic
      tasks.</p>
