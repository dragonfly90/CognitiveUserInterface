	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The ability to detect environmental regularities is a cognitive
      skill essential for survival. Human beings have a capacity, called numerical
      reasoning, to identify and extrapolate number serial patterns in such diverse
      areas as scientific discovery, economics, and the weather. Numerical reasoning
      and calculation have long been intimately associated, leading to the suggestion
      that they share a common system of the manipulation of numbers. The question of
      interest is whether numerical inductive reasoning is fully embedded in number
      calculation, or operates beyond calculation? To directly address these issues, we
      run an fMRI experiment to compare the number series completion task with the
      addition calculation task, and to understand the results in a cognitive
      architecture.

      Our results show that the fronto-parietal network was recruited uniquely in the
      numerical reasoning including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC
      46/9), left precentral gyrus (BA 6), right superior parietal lobule (BA 7) and
      left inferior occipital gyrus (BA 18); whereas the bilateral thalamus, caudate,
      and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) extending into cuneus were uniquely
      activated in calculation problems. This study suggested that relative to
      calculation, numerical reasoning is more related to spatial processing. A
      cognitive model predicts the behavioral results.</p>
